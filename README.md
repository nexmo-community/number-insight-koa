This project introduces the [Nexmo Number Insight API](https://developer.nexmo.com/number-insight/overview) and how to retrieve information about a number via a web interface using [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/).

To set up your own version, run the following commands after cloning the repo, or [remix the Glitch version](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/nexmo-number-insight-dashboard):

```bash
$ npm install
$ cp .example-env > .env # Remember to include your own API keys
$ node server.js
```
Remember to enter your Nexmo API credentials in your `.env` file.
